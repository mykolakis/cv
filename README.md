## **Payroll tax calculator API**

#### March 2022 \- October 2022

#### **NODE.JS, EXPRESS, TYPESCRIPT**

Calculator API allows you to calculate net pay or "take-home pay" by entering your per-period or annual salary along with the pertinent federal, state, and local W-4 information.

The goal was to develop an API endpoint that takes configuration files with tax computation-related data for each state of the United States and performs payroll tax calculations similar to Symmetry API (the most popular and accurate API in the US). Calculation results comparison has been done by testing the output results to be 0.01% accurate with Symmetry API for salary calculation.

#### October 2021 \- February 2022

#### **VUE.JS, NODE.JS**
#### **PHP, LARAVEL, RABBITMQ**
#### **MYSQL**

TecknaEl is a comparison site for electricity contracts targeting the Swedish and Spanish markets.

I've joined an existing project and worked on improving its features, current support, and further development. One of the first biggest goals was a huge client migration from a legacy site called elprisguiden.se with integration into the existing managing system. After migration and integration, I worked on a complex feature that allowed me to import or manually override specific company prices for electricity with the ability to use scrapped from web or manual overrides. One of the last required features was aggregated search results which should show sponsored companies before others which customers can control manually with their management system.

## [**Crowd Marketing Service**](https://referr-service.com/)

#### January 2016 \- December 2016

#### **JAVASCRIPT, ANGULARJS, JQUERY, PHP,  SYMFONY, MYSQL, SEO**

Service is divided into customer, poster, and admin (moderator, manager) panels. The customer creates a project by specifying the address of a website, description, and links necessary for SEO promotion. Then he picks the service plan and sends the project to the moderator which is picked automatically. Moderator checks approve or reject project created. He can indicate what information is missing and return the project back to the customer. The customer pays for the project and the promotion team starts working on it.

The poster publishes links and after approval of the moderator, they get to the customer and are expected to be approved by him too. Once all the necessary links of the project are considered to be completed it goes to the archive. Used PHP, Symfony, JavaScript, jQuery, and AngularJS tech stack.

As the only developer who has created the entire project from scratch. The project is still online, listed on the first page of Google for the CIS market. Great positive impact on SEO growth for customers.

The portal allows customers to find and recruit performers from different countries and service fields. Support for English, Russian, and Ukrainian languages.

Administrators are able to manage site features mentioned above as content of different static pages.

Symfony, PHP, AngularJS, and javascript with jQuery were used.

As the only developer, I've created an entire project from scratch. The project is currently offline because of huge competition in the service providers field in the CIS market.
